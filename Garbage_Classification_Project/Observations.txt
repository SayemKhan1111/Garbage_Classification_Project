Today I opened the GitHub notebook.
It uses Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2.
Image size required: 224x224
Dataset should be folder-wise classified.

Notebook steps include:
- Data loading
- Preprocessing
- Model building
- Training
- Evaluation

Main abhi tak code run nahi kiya, sirf samjha.
I did not run any code as of now i only undertand the project.
