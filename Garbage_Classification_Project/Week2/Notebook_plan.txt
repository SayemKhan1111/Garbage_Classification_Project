1. Import Libraries
2. Load and preprocess dataset (with EfficientNet preprocess_input)
3. Split data into training and validation (ImageDataGenerator)
4. Use EfficientNetV2B2 as base model (transfer learning)
5. Freeze base, add GAP + Dense layers
6. Compile and train model (with callbacks)
7. Evaluate: accuracy, confusion matrix, F1-score
8. Save model to .keras format
9. Build Gradio UI for prediction
10. Deploy app to Hugging Face Spaces
